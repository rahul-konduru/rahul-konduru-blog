In building resilient microservices, **health monitoring** plays a critical role in ensuring production readiness. **Spring Boot Actuator** provides powerful health endpoints that integrate seamlessly with orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes, enabling applications to be monitored and managed effectively.

However, a limitation exists: **Spring Boot Actuator does not include a built-in Kafka health indicator**, unlike the ready-made checks for databases, Redis, and other dependencies. Fortunately, **Spring Boot** allows developers to define custom health indicators for critical dependencies such as **Kafka**.

---

## Why Do We Need Health Indicators?

Kubernetes relies on *probes* to evaluate the health status of applications running in pods. These probes interact with Spring Boot Actuator health endpoints, allowing orchestrators to:

- Validate **Startup** using the Startup Probe  
- Assess **Liveness** using the Liveness Probe  
- Determine **Readiness** using the Readiness Probe 

Without accurate health indicators for critical dependencies such as **Kafka**, Kubernetes may route traffic to applications that cannot process messages. This can result in data loss, failed message processing, or service downtime. A robust Kafka health check ensures that microservices are genuinely *ready* and *operational* from an end-to-end perspective.

---

## Existing Approaches  

Many community implementations use **KafkaAdmin** to verify connectivity to a Kafka broker. This approach attempts broker-level operations to confirm basic Kafka connectivity.  

However, broker connectivity alone does not guarantee that both the **producer** and **consumer** sides of your application can function correctly. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ll take a different approach â€” extending health indicators to verify **producer** and **consumer** workflows.

---

## A Custom Kafka Health Indicator  

Depending on your use case, you may implement either or both. For example:  
- A service responsible only for publishing messages may implement a **producer health check**.  
- A service that primarily processes Kafka messages would benefit more from a **consumer health check**.  
- In some cases, you may want to combine both for stronger validation.

## Coding the Health Indicator

Spring Boot provides a streamlined mechanism for defining custom health indicators by either implementing the [`HealthIndicator`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/HealthIndicator.html) interface or extending the [`AbstractHealthIndicator`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/api/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/AbstractHealthIndicator.html) base class. For enhanced simplicity and consistency, it is recommended to extend `AbstractHealthIndicator`, as this abstract class encapsulates the construction of the `Health` response and offers built-in exception handling. This approach enables developers to focus exclusively on implementing the specific health check logic relevant to their component or subsystem.

### Sample Implementation Structure

Create a class named `KafkaHealthIndicator` that extends `AbstractHealthIndicator` and annotate it with `@Component` so that it is registered as a Spring bean:

```java
@Component
public class KafkaHealthIndicator extends AbstractHealthIndicator {

    @Override
    protected void doHealthCheck(Health.Builder builder) throws Exception {
        // Kafka health check logic
    }
}
```

#### Consumer Health Verification

Inject `KafkaListenerEndpointRegistry` and check the `connection-count` metric for any one listener to validate consumer connections:

```java
@Autowired
private KafkaListenerEndpointRegistry kafkaListenerEndpointRegistry;

private boolean isConsumerHealthy() {
    Metric metric = kafkaListenerEndpointRegistry.getListenerContainers().stream()
            .flatMap(container -> container.metrics().values().stream())
            .flatMap(metricsMap -> metricsMap.entrySet().stream())
            .filter(entry -> "connection-count".equalsIgnoreCase(entry.getKey().name()))
            .map(Map.Entry::getValue)
            .findFirst()
            .orElseThrow();
    return (Double)metric.metricValue() != 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
The `KafkaListenerEndpointRegistry` tracks consumer metrics across all listeners. The `connection-count` metric represents the number of active broker connections. A non-zero value confirms that the applicationâ€™s consumers are live.

#### Producer Health Verification

Similarly, use the `KafkaTemplate` bean to check the producerâ€™s connection count:

```java
@Autowired
private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

private boolean isProducerHealthy() {
    Metric metric = kafkaTemplate.metrics().entrySet().stream()
            .filter(es -> "connection-count".equalsIgnoreCase(es.getKey().name()))
            .map(Map.Entry::getValue)
            .findFirst()
            .orElseThrow();
    return (Double)metric.metricValue() != 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
By retrieving the producerâ€™s `connection-count` metric, the health indicator verifies that outbound Kafka connections are active and capable of sending messages.

---

### Final Health Indicator Example

The composite check integrates both producer and consumer validation:

```java
@Component
public class KafkaHealthIndicator extends AbstractHealthIndicator {

    @Autowired
    private KafkaListenerEndpointRegistry kafkaListenerEndpointRegistry;

    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    @Override
    protected void doHealthCheck(Health.Builder builder) throws Exception {
        if (isConsumerHealthy() && isProducerHealthy()) {
            builder.up();
        } else {
            builder.down();
        }
    }

    private boolean isConsumerHealthy() {
        // ...implementation as above
    }

    private boolean isProducerHealthy() {
        // ...implementation as above
    }
}
```

---

## Configuration: Enabling Health Groups

By default, custom indicators are **not included** in liveness/readiness probes. To configure them, update `application.yml`:

```yaml
management:
  endpoint:
    health:
      probes:
        enabled: true
      group:
        liveness:
          include: kafka
        readiness:
          include: kafka
```

**Note:**
Spring automatically generates the indicator name by removing `HealthIndicator` from the class nameâ€”thus the indicator is available as `kafka`.

For enhanced diagnostics, enable detailed output:

```yaml
management:
  endpoint:
    health:
      probes:
        enabled: true
      show-details: always
```

This exposes component-level statuses in the health endpoint:

```json
{"components":{"kafka":{"status":"UP"}},"status":"UP"}
```

## Wrapping Up  

Spring Bootâ€™s extensibility lets us go beyond the built-in health checks and create **Kafka-specific health indicators**. These improve the reliability of your service by allowing Kubernetes (or any orchestrator) to make informed decisions about your applicationâ€™s state.  

By verifying both Kafka producer and consumer functionality, your health endpoints more accurately represent the applicationâ€™s readiness to handle traffic.  

When deploying a Spring Boot service that depends on Kafka, avoid relying solely on broker connectivity checks; instead, implement a robust custom health indicator.
